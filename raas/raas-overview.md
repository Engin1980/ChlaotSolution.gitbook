# RaaS Overview

The _Runway Awareness and Advisory System_ (RAAS) is an electronic detection system designed to enhance flight crew situational awareness during ground operations. By providing audible alerts regarding aircraft position relative to runways, RAAS aims to reduce the risk of runway incursions, confusion, and excursions. The system utilizes data from the aircraft's Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS) and onboard sensors to monitor movements and issue advisories, such as confirming runway identification during approach and takeoff, alerting if the aircraft is on a taxiway instead of a runway, and indicating remaining runway distance during landing.

The **Runway Awareness and Advisory System (RAAS)** provides pilots with several key voice advisories that help with airport navigation and enhance safety. Below are the main advisories:

* **Advisories when approaching a runway:**
  * **"Approaching Runway \[XX]"** – The aircraft is approaching a specific runway.
  * **"Approaching Short Runway \[XX]"** – Warning if the runway is shorter than the minimum required length for a safe landing or takeoff (not supported yet).
* **Advisories when entering a runway:**
  * **"On Runway \[XX]"** – The aircraft is on a specific runway.
  * **"On Runway \[XX], Short Runway"** – The aircraft is on a short runway, warning the pilot of a potential risk (not supported yet).
* **Advisories during landing:**
  * **"Approaching Runway \[XX]"** – Confirmation that the aircraft is approaching the correct runway.
  * **"Distance Remaining \[XXXX] Feet"** – Information about the remaining runway length during takeoff or landing.

These advisories help pilots navigate the airport environment, reducing the risk of **landing on the wrong runway, taking off from an incorrect location, or insufficient runway length**.
