# EFS-Extensions

EFS Extensions  is a extending tool for Flight Simulator providing some interesting features:

* Checklists - the ability to read checklists during the flight
* Copilot Speeches - the copilot callouts at specific phases of flight (like, V-one, V-rotate, V-two, etc.)
* Failures - the ability to invoke randomly based failures (airplane specific)
* RaaS - the most basic RaaS automatic callouts.
